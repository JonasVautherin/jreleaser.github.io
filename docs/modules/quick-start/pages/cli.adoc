= Command Line

Once JReleaser is xref:ROOT:install.adoc#_cli[installed] you may initialize its config file by invoking the following command:

[source]
----
$ jreleaser init --format yml
[INFO]  Writing file /Home/duke/app/jreleaser.yml
[INFO]  JReleaser initialized at /Home/duke/app
----

TIP: JReleaser supports the following formats: `yml`, `toml`, `json`.

This generates a `jreleaser.yml` file with the following configuration

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros"]
.jreleaser.yml
----

Edit the file to suite your needs. You may use the xref:reference:assemble/archive.adoc[Archive] assembler to
create a binary distribution, or use any other means at your disposal to create such a file.
Once you have edited the file you may verify its configuration by invoking

[source]
----
$ jreleaser config

At any time you may invoke any of the other commands, but when it's time to make a release you have to invoke

This command performs the following actions:

* checksums all artifacts.
* signs all files (if signing is enabled).
* creates a release at the chosen Git repository.
* prepares, packages, and uploads configured packagers (brew, jbang, etc).
* announces the release (if configured).

TIP: JReleaser generates 2 files after most commands are run. These are `output.properties` and `trace.log`. The first
contains a set of calculated values such as the project version, tag, timestamp, and more. The second contains the
full execution log plus any stacktraces in case of errors. You'll find these files inside `out/jreleaser`.

== Next Steps

* Browse xref:reference:index.adoc[] options.
* Discover all capabilities exposed by the xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[].
* Review the xref:ROOT:checklist.adoc[] before releasing.

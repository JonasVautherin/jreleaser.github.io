= Apache Ant

Your Ant build must be configured to create binary distributions (Zips and Tars). Review the
link:http://ant.apache.org/[Ant] documentation to find out how to do that. Follow the instructions
in the xref:ROOT:install.adoc#_apache_ant[Apache Ant] section of the xref:ROOT:install.adoc[] page to download and install the JReleaser Ant tasks. Once configured
you can bootstrap a configuration file

[source]
----
$ ant jreleaser-init -Djreleaser.format=yml
Buildfile: /Home/duke/app/build.xml

jreleaser-init:
Writing file /Home/duke/app/jreleaser.yml

TIP: JReleaser supports the following formats: `yml`, `toml`, `json`.

This generates a `jreleaser.yml` file with the following configuration

Edit the file to suite your needs. You may use the xref:reference:assemble/archive.adoc[Archive] assembler to
create a binary distribution, or any other existing Ant tasks you may already have to create such files.
Once you have edited the file you may verify its configuration by invoking

[source]
----
$ ant jreleaser-config

At any time you may invoke any of the other commands, but when it's time to make a release you have to invoke

This command performs the following actions:

* checksums all artifacts.
* signs all files (if signing is enabled).
* creates a release at the chosen Git repository.
* prepares, packages, and uploads configured packagers (brew, jbang, etc).
* announces the release.

TIP: JReleaser generates 2 files after most commands are run. These are `output.properties` and `trace.log`. The first
contains a set of calculated values such as the project version, tag, timestamp, and more. The second contains the
full execution log plus any stacktraces in case of errors. You'll find these files inside `out/jreleaser`.

== Next Steps

* Browse xref:reference:index.adoc[] options.
* Discover all capabilities exposed by the xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[].
* Review the xref:ROOT:checklist.adoc[] before releasing.
